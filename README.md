# Causality on breast cancer data
### The purpose of this project is to 
- Perform a causal inference task using Pearl’s framework
- Infer the causal graph from observational data and then validate the graph
- Merge machine learning with causal inference

on [breast cancer dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

This breast cancer data includes 569 examples of cancer biopsies, each with 32 features. One feature is an identification number, another is the cancer diagnosis and 30 are numeric-valued laboratory measurements. The diagnosis is coded as "M" to indicate malignant or "B" to indicate benign.

The other 30 numeric measurements comprise the mean, standard error and worst (i.e. largest) value for 10 different characteristics of the digitized cell nuclei, which are as follows:-
- Radius
- Texture
- Perimeter
- Area
- Smoothness
- Compactness
- Concavity
- Concave Points
- Symmetry
- Fractal dimension
